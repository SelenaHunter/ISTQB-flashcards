# ISTQB Flashcard Study Guide

## Getting Started

This app presents a series of flashcards 

This is flashcard-based study guide for the US Citizenship exam. In the real exam, you get 10 questions randomly chosen from a list of 100. You must get 6/10 correct to pass the civics exam portion of your application for citizenship.

This app uses the [100 civics questions from the US government](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learners/study-test) and presents them in flashcard format to help you study. In the offical materials, the US government acknowledges more than one answer may be correct. In the interests of doing things their way, I've listed all the recommended "alternative" answers for each question.

The civics test might be hard, but hopefully this guide can make studying a little easier for someone!
