A tool that provides an environment for unit or component testing in which a component can be tested in isolation or with suitable stubs and drivers. It
also provides other support for the developer, such as debugging capabilities.
usability
Ref: After ISO 25010
The degree to which a component or system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals in a specified context of use.
usability evaluation
See Also: formative evaluation, summative evaluation
A process through which information about the usability of a system is gathered in order to improve the system (known as formative evaluation) or to
assess the merit or worth of a system (known as summative evaluation).
usability lab
A test facility in which unintrusive observation of participant reactions and responses to software takes place.
usability requirement
A requirement on the usability of a component or system.
usability test participant
A representative user who solves typical tasks in a usability test.
usability test script
A document specifying a sequence of actions for the execution of a usability test. It is used by the moderator to keep track of briefing and pre-session
interview questions, usability test tasks, and post-session interview questions.
usability test session
A test session in usability testing in which a usability test participant is executing tests, moderated by a moderator and observed by a number of
observers.
usability test task
A usability test execution activity specified by the moderator that needs to be accomplished by a usability test participant within a given period of time.
usability testing
Ref: After ISO 25010
Testing to evaluate the degree to which the system can be used by specified users with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of
use.
use case testing
Synonyms: user scenario testing, scenario testing
A black-box test technique in which test cases are designed to exercise use case behaviors.
user acceptance testing (UAT)
See Also: acceptance testing
A type of acceptance testing performed to determine if intended users accept the system.
user error protection
Ref: After ISO 25010
The degree to which a component or system protects users against making errors.
user experience
Ref: ISO 9241-210
A person's perceptions and responses resulting from the use or anticipated use of a software product.
user interface
All components of a system that provide information and controls for the user to accomplish specific tasks with the system.
user interface aesthetics
Ref: ISO 25010
Synonyms: attractiveness
The degree to which a user interface enables pleasing and satisfying interaction for the user.
user interface guideline
A low-level, specific rule or recommendation for user interface design that leaves little room for interpretation so designers implement it similarly. It is
often used to ensure consistency in the appearance and behavior of the user interface of the systems produced by an organization.
user story
A user or business requirement consisting of one sentence expressed in the everyday or business language which is capturing the functionality a user
needs, the reason behind it, any non-functional criteria, and also including acceptance criteria.
user story testing
A black-box test technique in which test cases are designed based on user stories to verify their correct implementation.
user survey
A usability evaluation whereby a representative sample of users are asked to report subjective evaluation into a questionnaire based on their experience
in using a component or system.
user-agent based testing
A type of testing in which a test client is used to switch the user agent string and identify itself as a different client while executing test suites.
user-based quality
Ref: After Garvin See Also: manufacturing-based quality, product-based quality, transcendent-based quality, value-based quality
A view of quality measured by the degree that the needs, wants, and desires of a user are met.
V-model
A sequential software development lifecycle model describing a one-for-one relationship between major phases of software development from business
requirements specification to delivery, and corresponding test levels from acceptance testing to component testing.

validation
Ref: ISO 9000
Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have been
fulfilled.

value change coverage
The coverage of neurons activated where their activation values differ by more than a change amount in the neural network for a set of tests.
